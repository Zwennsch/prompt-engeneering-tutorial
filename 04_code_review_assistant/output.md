Here are some suggestions to improve the given Python code:

1. Add comments to explain the purpose of the function and how it works.
2. Consider adding input validation to handle cases where `b` is zero to avoid potential division by zero errors.
3. Use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.
4. Consider adding type hints to the function signature for better code documentation.
5. Consider using the `math.floor()` function instead of the `//` operator for integer division to handle negative numbers correctly.

Here's an updated version of the code with these suggestions implemented:

```python
import math

def get_quotient(dividend: int, divisor: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the integer division quotient of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        dividend (int): The number to be divided.
        divisor (int): The number to divide by.
    
    Returns:
        int: The integer division quotient of the two numbers.
    """
    if divisor == 0:
        raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed.")
    
    return math.floor(dividend / divisor)
``` 

By incorporating these suggestions, the code will be more robust, readable, and maintainable.
